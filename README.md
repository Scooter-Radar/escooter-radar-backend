# Description

### E-scooter
Electric scooters (e-scooter) are defined as motorized bicycles propelled by human power or by a combination of human power and an electric motor. Electric scooters are easy to ride and let you breeze up and down hills without even breaking a drop of sweat.

Recently, electric kick scooters (e-scooters) have grown in popularity with the introduction of scooter-sharing systems that use apps allowing users to rent the scooters by the minute.

### Scooter-sharing system
A scooter-sharing system is a shared transport service in which electric motorized scooters (also referred to as e-scooters) are made available to use for short-term rentals. E-scooters are typically "dockless", meaning that they do not have a fixed home location and are dropped off and picked up from certain locations in the service area.

Scooter-sharing systems work towards providing the public with a fast and convenient mode of transport for last-mile mobility in urban areas. Due to the growing popularity of scooter-sharing, municipal governments have enforced regulations on e-scooters to increase rider and pedestrian safety while avoiding the accrual of visual pollution. Scooter-sharing systems are one of the least expensive and most popular micromobility options.

  - **Lime**

NB: I'm highly dependent on the data made available by the scooter suppliers, 
  so if the api doesn't show the scooters in your city, don't be harsh on me ðŸ˜¥
